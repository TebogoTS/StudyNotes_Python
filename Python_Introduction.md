## Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values.

Variables are like labeled boxes in which you can store different types of information.
They hold data values that can be accessed, modified, and used throughout your program.

In Python, you can assign values to variables using the assignment operator (`=`).
Variable names should follow certain rules, such as starting with a letter or underscore, not starting with a number and being case-sensitive.

### Example of variables
```
x = 5
name = "Alice"
is_valid = True
```

## Basic Math

Python supports various arithmetic operations for basic mathematical computations.
You can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
These operations can be applied to numeric values.

### Example of basic math

```
a = 10
b = 3
sum_result = a + b
diff_result = a - b
mul_result = a * b
div_result = a / b
```

## Comments

Comments are used to explain code and are ignored by the interpreter.

Comments in Python are used to annotate or explain code. 
They are not executed by the interpreter and are there to provide insights into code for better understanding.
Comments can be single-line (using `#`).


```
# This is a single-line comment.

"""
This is a 
multi-line string
NOT A COMMENT
"""
```

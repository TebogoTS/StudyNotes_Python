## Built-in Functions

Python has several built-in functions that can be used directly.

Python comes with a set of pre-defined functions that are readily available for use.
These functions serve various purposes and can perform specific tasks without requiring you to write code for them from scratch.

### Example of built-in functions

```
print(len([1, 2, 3]))
print(max(4, 6, 2))
```

## Print

The `print()` function is used to display output to console or terminal. 
It takes one or more arguments and outputs them as text.

### Example of print

```
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Range

`range()` function in python generates a sequence of numbers.
It can take one, two, ore three arguments, representing start, stop, and step values.

### Example of range

```
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

This code snippet is a simple Python script that demonstrates how to define a list and access its elements using an index. 

---

```python
spells = [
    "Riddikulus!",
    "Wingardium Leviosa!",
    "Avada Kedavra!",
    "Expecto Patronum!",
    "Nox!",
    "Lumos!",
    ]
```

1. **List Definition**:
   - `spells` is a Python list. A list is a collection of items enclosed in square brackets (`[]`) and separated by commas.
   - Each item in this list is a string, representing a magical spell from the Harry Potter universe.

2. **List Contents**:
   - The list contains six spells, each as a string:
     1. `"Riddikulus!"`
     2. `"Wingardium Leviosa!"`
     3. `"Avada Kedavra!"`
     4. `"Expecto Patronum!"`
     5. `"Nox!"`
     6. `"Lumos!"`

---

```python
print(spells[3])
```

3. **Indexing**:
   - Lists in Python are indexed starting at `0`. This means the first item is at index `0`, the second at index `1`, and so on.
   - `spells[3]` accesses the fourth item in the list, `"Expecto Patronum!"`, because its index is `3`.

4. **Printing**:
   - The `print` function outputs the accessed item to the console. In this case, it will print:
     ```
     Expecto Patronum!
     ```

---

### Output:
When you run this script, it will display:
```
Expecto Patronum!
```
